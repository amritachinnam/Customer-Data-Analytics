## 🐾 Building a Power BI Report for Waggle

### 📌 Project Overview

Waggle is a startup specializing in smart pet devices. After the success of their **Lapdog** fitness collar for dogs, they developed a **Lapcat** prototype for cats and conducted field testing with 1,000 units.

This project delivers a boardroom-ready Power BI report to compare Lapcat data with Lapdog insights, helping executives determine whether Lapcat is a viable product or a costly risk.

### 🎯 Key Business Objectives

✔️ Assess customer satisfaction for both devices.
✔️ Understand pet demographics and identify patterns in breed, age, and engagement.
✔️ Analyze family insights—household income, pet ownership trends, and spending behavior.
✔️ Provide a boardroom-ready Power BI report with slicers, filters, and interactive elements.

### 🚀 Final Conclusion
The analysis clearly shows that **Lapcat has significantly lower adoption, engagement, and customer satisfaction** compared to Lapdog. While **Lapdog users exhibited increasing activity levels and high satisfaction (4.69 average rating), Lapcat users showed minimal activity change and low satisfaction (1.64 average rating).**  

**Key Findings:**  
✔️ **Cat owners engage less with wearable fitness devices**, suggesting **lower demand** for Lapcat.  
✔️ **Higher-income, multi-pet households** remain the ideal target market for smart pet devices, but **dogs are the primary consumers.**  
❌ **Lapcat, in its current form, does not justify mass production** due to **limited adoption and weak user satisfaction.**  

**Strategic Recommendations:**  
🔹 **Enhance Lapcat’s features** to offer more value to cat owners, focusing on health monitoring rather than fitness tracking.  
🔹 **Reposition the product** to better align with cat owners' needs and expectations.  
🔹 **Conduct further market research** to refine Lapcat’s value proposition before investing in full-scale production.  

🚨 **Final Decision:** **Given the current data, investing heavily in Lapcat presents a high risk. Resources would be better allocated to further optimizing Lapdog’s success and refining Lapcat’s positioning before a wider launch.**
